# dotnetzip-for-unity #
This is a stripped-down version of DotNetZip (no BZip2/GZip support for now) with some fixes so it can be used on Unity projects, including those that target Android and iOS.

This project is licensed under the Ms-PL, packaged within this project as
"LICENSE.md".

Thanks to Ed Ropple <ed+dotnetzip@edropple.com> for the original GitHub mirror of DotNetZip.

## How to use ##
Copy the git URL to your clipboard, by clicking the `Code` button in the upper right of the main repository page. Then, in the Unity Package manager, click the `+` button to the upper left of the window. Select `Add package from git URL`, paste in the URL you copied earlier, and press `Add`.

The library has been extensively tested in Android devices, however, some issues can arise when targeting iOS devices. Feel free to report any bugs you find.
